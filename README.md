# Weather app

## vanilla JS project with HTML and SASS

Simple and basic project to practise APIs, promise functions and async functions. The app gets location permissions on first render and then calls the api based on the longitude and latitude acquired; rendering the data onto the UI.

Features to add
* add search functionality so user can search for different cities
* improve design
