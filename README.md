# Weather app

## vanilla JS project with HTML and SASS

Very basic and simple project to practise APIs, promise functions and async functions. The app gets location permissions on first render and calls the api based on the longitude and latitude acquired; and then renders the data onto the UI.

#### improvements

add search functionality so user can search for different cities
